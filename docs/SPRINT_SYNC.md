# Unified Sprint Plan — CorpusForge + HybridRAG V2

**Last Updated:** 2026-04-09 | **Updated By:** reviewer — mirrored Forge corpus-adaptation profiling status into V2, including the checked-in export-analysis generator, the evidence packet, and CA.1 ready-for-QA state.
**Demo Target:** 2026-05-02
**Update Rule:** Every agent updates ALL 3 copies at end of sprint session (review board + both repos)

---

## Active Agents

| Agent | Role | Repo | GPU | Status |
|-------|------|------|-----|--------|
| reviewer | Forge Sprint 6 critical path | C:\CorpusForge | GPU 0 default | ACTIVE |
| reviewer | Forge Sprint 7 sample analysis | C:\CorpusForge_Dev | CPU / GPU 1 as needed | HANDOFF POSTED (accepted export delivered to reviewer) |
| reviewer | V2 Sprint 16 accepted-export import/eval | C:\HybridRAG_V2_Dev | GPU 1 chosen (GPU 0 heavily occupied at run start) | READY FOR QA (clone-local phase 2 complete; no reviewer write commands targeted mainline V2; promotion hold recommended) |
| QA | Validation standby | Read-only until a lane posts Ready for QA | Lesser-used GPU when needed | STANDBY |

**Copies of this file (keep all 3 in sync):**
- `{USER_HOME}\AgentTeam\war_rooms\HybridRAG3_Educational\SPRINT_SYNC.md` (canonical)
- `C:\CorpusForge\docs\SPRINT_SYNC.md`
- `C:\HybridRAG_V2\docs\SPRINT_SYNC.md`

---

## QA Standby Protocol

- Do not start active validation until a lane posts `Ready for QA`.
- Use absolute repo roots only: `C:\CorpusForge` and `C:\HybridRAG_V2`. If assigned a clone lane, use the exact clone root Jeremy assigned.
- Use repo-local venvs only.
- Use real hardware, real CUDA, and real production data or the real 1000-file subset whenever available.
- Constrain each validation run to one GPU with `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`. If both GPUs are active, take the lesser-used GPU and document the choice.
- Review the lane's deep packet or evidence packet before testing.
- Before judging OCR or scanned-PDF behavior in CorpusForge, check workstation prerequisites with `where.exe tesseract` and `where.exe pdftoppm`.
- If either OCR tool is missing, record OCR or scanned-document gaps as environment prerequisites unless the lane overclaimed OCR-ready or production-ready status.
- Missing OCR tools is not a code failure for text-first validation; text parsing, dedup, regex extraction, V2 import, and golden eval still count as normal code or test findings.
- Evidence packets must state whether OCR tools were present and whether the lane was text-only or OCR-capable.
- If GUI was touched, require full GUI harness Tiers A-D plus human button smash by a non-author.
- Findings-first reporting only. If there are no findings, say exactly: `No findings.`
- Before signoff, verify: both sprint boards updated; dated evidence or handoff note present; repo, branch, GPU, and data path documented; commands and outputs documented; real-data pass documented; GUI harness and button smash documented if GUI changed; blockers and residual risks documented.

## EMERGENCY: Sprint 6 (Forge) + Sprint 16 (V2) — Production Ingest Blockers

**Added:** 2026-04-08 | **Why:** Four P0 blockers discovered that prevent production 700GB corpus ingest

**Coordinator Update:** 2026-04-08 MDT — catch-up mode now runs as three parallel lanes:
- `reviewer` owns `C:\CorpusForge` mainline and the Forge Sprint 6 critical path only.
- `reviewer` owns `C:\CorpusForge_Dev` and the Sprint 7 real-data analysis lane.
- `reviewer` owns `C:\HybridRAG_V2_Dev` and the V2 Sprint 16 accepted-export import/eval lane.
- QA stays on standby and picks up validation as soon as a lane posts `Ready for QA`.

**Crash/Handoff Rule:** Before any lane pauses for more than 30 minutes, changes ownership, or claims completion, it must:
1. update both `docs/SPRINT_SYNC.md` copies,
2. write a dated handoff/evidence note under `docs/`,
3. record repo, branch, GPU assignment, data subset, commands run, outputs, blockers, and next step.

**Execution Rules:**
- Use the real repo, repo-local venv, real hardware, and real production data whenever possible per `docs/Repo_Rules_2026-04-04.md` and the shared QA protocol in `C:\HybridRAG_V2\docs\QA_EXPECTATIONS_2026-04-05.md`.
- Constrain each run to one GPU with `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`; if both GPUs are busy, take the lesser-used GPU and document the choice.
- Mainline Forge keeps GPU 0 by default; clone/sample or V2 rehearsal lanes use GPU 1 by default unless telemetry shows GPU 0 is less loaded.
- Any GUI-touching slice must run the full GUI harness tiers A-D from `C:\HybridRAG_V2\docs\QA_GUI_HARNESS_2026-04-05.md`, including a human button smash by a non-author before signoff.
- Every completion note must include a deep evidence packet: real-data subset used, hardware, GPU, commands, key metrics, logs/screenshots, and whether GUI harness/button smash ran.


### Forge Sprint 6: Production Ingest Enablement (P0 — START IMMEDIATELY)

**Ownership:** reviewer is the only writer on `C:\CorpusForge` mainline and the primary owner of production dedup/hash state.

| Slice | Repo | Priority | What | Status | Owner |
|-------|------|----------|------|--------|-------|
| 6.1 | Forge | P0 | Bulk transfer syncer + GUI Transfer panel + CLI run_transfer.py | DONE (2026-04-08) | reviewer |
| 6.2 | Forge | P0 | Deduplicator fixed: mtime tolerance, _N suffix, progress callback, 15 tests | DONE (2026-04-08) | reviewer |
| 6.3 | Forge | P0 | GUI progress: all stages emit on_stage_progress every 5s, CLI heartbeat | DONE (2026-04-08) | reviewer |
| 6.4 | Forge | P0 | Sanitizer: 6 patterns added, .gitignore updated, 126 files clean. V2 needs reviewer parity. | DONE (Forge, 2026-04-08) | reviewer |
| 6.5 | Forge | P0 | Dedup-only GUI panel with scanned/dupes/current/elapsed/ETA | DONE (2026-04-08) | reviewer |
| 6.6 | Forge | P0 | Production corpus ingest (blocked on QA of 6.1-6.5) | **RUN 6 LANDED CLEAN, ZERO SAO/RSF LEAK VERIFIED (2026-04-09 07:25 MDT).** New canonical export available at `C:\CorpusForge\data\production_output\export_20260409_0720\` — **242,650 chunks + 242,650 vectors float16, 32 minute runtime**. Hard verification: `*.sao.zip`=0, `*.rsf.zip`=0, any 'sao' dot-segment=0, any 'rsf' dot-segment=0. Equivalence vs Run 5+filter: 242,650 vs 244,074 → within 0.6%. The CorpusForge archive-defer fix from `src/parse/parsers/archive_parser.py` is operational at production scale. **MORNING RECOMMENDATION (UPDATED):** import the clean Run 6 export with `--source C:\CorpusForge\data\production_output\export_20260409_0720 --create-index`. **NO `--exclude-source-glob` filter is needed** for Run 6 — the cleanliness is at the source. The V2 import-side filter (`scripts/import_embedengine.py --exclude-source-glob GLOB`) and durable `import_report_*.json` artifact remain available as a safety net for retroactive Run 5 imports or any future leaked export. UNRESOLVED before operational signoff: code-state provenance (linter/other edits in pipeline.py), `.ppt` legacy garbage (178 chunks), Forge 6.1-6.5 QA gate. NOTE on files_failed=7068 in Run 6 stats: ~6,550 of those are SAO.zip archives that the new defer fix correctly refuses to extract — semantic mislabeling, not real failures. Evidence: `C:\CorpusForge\docs\SPRINT_6_6_EVIDENCE_2026-04-08.md`, `C:\CorpusForge\docs\HANDOVER_2026-04-09.md`, `C:\CorpusForge\data\production_output\export_20260409_0720\READ_ME_BEFORE_USE.txt`. | reviewer |

**Exit Criteria:** Operator can transfer 700GB, dedup it, see live progress at every stage, and produce clean exports for V2. Zero program-specific terms on remote.

### Forge Nightly Delta Scheduling Lane (READY FOR QA)

| Slice | Repo | Priority | What | Status | Owner |
|-------|------|----------|------|--------|-------|
| ND.1 | Forge | P0 | Source-side delta tracking with persisted resume state and canary accounting | DONE (`C:\CorpusForge\src\download\delta_tracker.py`; source file state uses `hashed` -> `mirrored` in `transfer_state_db`) | reviewer |
| ND.2 | Forge | P0 | Nightly delta orchestration: scan source, mirror delta only, write manifests/input-list, then run the normal pipeline on the mirrored subset | DONE (`C:\CorpusForge\scripts\run_nightly_delta.py`; clean stop via signal or `stop_file`; exported chunks preserve original source provenance) | reviewer |
| ND.3 | Forge | P1 | Workstation scheduled-task helper | DONE (`C:\CorpusForge\scripts\install_nightly_delta_task.py`; XML emitted successfully, task installation intentionally not executed in the proof lane) | reviewer |
| ND.4 | Forge | P1 | Config wiring and operator proof | DONE (`C:\CorpusForge\config\config.yaml` + `C:\CorpusForge\src\config\schema.py`; single active `nightly_delta` block; proof root `C:\CorpusForge\data\nightly_delta_proof_20260409` showed pass 1 `2 delta/2 chunks`, pass 2 `1 changed/1 chunk`, pass 3 `0 delta`) | reviewer |
| ND.5 | Forge | P1 | Validation and operator evidence | DONE (focused pytest lane plus automated GUI regression passed; no GUI files changed in this lane, so full Tier A-D plus non-author human smash was not triggered; OCR tools absent, so lane is text-first only) | reviewer |

### V2 Sprint 16: Clean Import + Sanitization

**Execution Note:** reviewer completed the accepted-export proof in `C:\HybridRAG_V2_Dev`; promotion to the main V2 store still waits for explicit approval after QA and remediation.

| Slice | Repo | Priority | What | Status | Owner |
|-------|------|----------|------|--------|-------|
| 16.1 | V2 | P0 | Sanitizer fix — same patterns as Forge 6.4. Run --apply on tracked files. Push clean when verified. | DONE IN V2_Dev (parity script ported, banned filename check added, 2 tracked fixtures sanitized) | reviewer |
| 16.2 | V2 | P0 | Add CoPilot+.md to .gitignore — never push agent instruction files to remote | DONE IN V2_Dev (CoPilot+.md + config.local ignored; CoPilot+.md removed from git index) | reviewer |
| 16.3 | V2 | P0 | Import fresh Forge export — subset rehearsal now in V2_Dev, full production rebuild after Forge 6.6 | DONE IN V2_Dev (accepted export `C:\CorpusForge_Dev\data\output_dev\export_20260408_2051`; imported `83,022` chunks from `947` docs into clone-local `data\index_dev\lancedb`; IVF_PQ index ready) | reviewer |
| 16.4 | V2 | P0 | Run tiered extraction — subset now, full production corpus after 16.3/Forge 6.6. Tier 1 regex + Tier 2 GLiNER on single GPU. | DONE IN V2_Dev (single-GPU run on physical GPU 1 via `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1`; `302,748` entity rows and `0` relationship rows in clone-local `entities.sqlite3`; fixed Tier 2 `tier1_chunk_ids` filter bug in `scripts/tiered_extract.py`, narrowing GLiNER to `15,473` chunks) | reviewer |
| 16.5 | V2 | P0 | Golden eval — subset now, production target 20/25 after 16.4 full run | READY FOR QA IN V2_Dev (retrieval-only eval `11/36`, routing `32/36`, avg `81 ms`; direct corpus-native probes positive; promotion hold recommended pending relationship coverage, entity-noise cleanup, and eval alignment) | reviewer |

**Exit Criteria:** Zero program-specific terms on remote. Clean V2 store from production corpus. 20/25 golden eval on real data.

### V2 Sprint 16B: Mainline Staging/Import Automation (NEW)

**Added:** 2026-04-09 | **Owner:** reviewer | **Purpose:** make nightly Forge handoff import flow explicit, artifact-backed, and QA-friendly on mainline V2.

| Slice | Repo | Priority | What | Status | Owner |
|-------|------|----------|------|--------|-------|
| 16B.1 | V2 | P0 | Add staging orchestrator around import path with explicit source selection, deterministic `latest` helper, and durable stage artifacts | DONE (`scripts/stage_forge_import.py`) | reviewer |
| 16B.2 | V2 | P0 | Add canary subset + delta validation support so nightly handoff can be smoke-tested before full write | DONE (canary export + `delta_validation.json` + ledger) | reviewer |
| 16B.3 | V2 | P0 | Keep fallback safety visible: explicit import-side filters and planned command artifact, no hidden defaults | DONE (recorded in `source_selection.json`, `planned_import_command.txt`, `stage_result.json`) | reviewer |
| 16B.4 | V2 | P1 | Publish operator runbook for morning handoff path (plan -> canary dry-run -> full import) | DONE (`docs/V2_STAGING_IMPORT_RUNBOOK_2026-04-09.md`) | reviewer |
| 16B.5 | V2 | P1 | Add focused tests for deterministic selection, canary subset integrity, and delta calculations | DONE (`tests/test_stage_forge_import.py`) | reviewer |

**Exit Criteria:** Operator can stage nightly Forge exports with explicit artifacts, run canary/delta checks, and execute full import with visible safeguards.

## Sprint 7 (Forge): Production Data Analysis + Recovery Strategy (NEW)

**Added:** 2026-04-08 | **Data:** 90GB production source at `C:\CorpusForge\ProductionSource`
**Agent:** reviewer (export production) + reviewer (V2 consumption) — works in clone repos `C:\CorpusForge_Dev` and `C:\HybridRAG_V2_Dev`
**Purpose:** Use real production data to refine dedup strategy, extraction patterns, enrichment quality, and chunking parameters before the full 700GB ingest.
**Execution Note:** reviewer produced the accepted 1000-file export package; reviewer consumed that package in `C:\HybridRAG_V2_Dev` for Sprint 16 phase 2.

| Slice | Repo | Priority | What | Status | Owner |
|-------|------|----------|------|--------|-------|
| 7.1 | Forge_Dev | P0 | Dedup analysis on 90GB — run dedup on ProductionSource, report: total files, unique files, duplicate families, format distribution, volume reduction %, duplicate patterns (suffix _1, cross-format .doc/.docx/.pdf). Preserve hash state for incremental skip continuity. | DONE (49.7% dupes, all _1 suffix, zero cross-format. Evidence: SLICE_7_1_DEDUP_EVIDENCE_2026-04-08.md) | reviewer |
| 7.2 | Forge_Dev | P0 | Format coverage audit — what formats actually appear in production data? Which parsers succeed/fail? Which produce quality chunks vs garbage? Report per-format: file count, parse success rate, avg chunks per file, quality score distribution. | DONE (TEXT-ONLY — Tesseract/Poppler missing. ~2,450 text files parseable, .rsf is junk. Evidence: SLICE_7_2_FORMAT_COVERAGE_EVIDENCE_2026-04-08.md) | reviewer |
| 7.3 | Forge_Dev | P1 | Chunking quality analysis — are 1200/200 settings optimal for these document types? Sample 500 chunks, review: are boundaries sensible? Do headings get preserved? Are tables split badly? Recommend tuning. | DONE (77% chunks in target range, 1200/200 confirmed. Evidence: SLICE_7_3_CHUNKING_QUALITY_EVIDENCE_2026-04-08.md) | reviewer |
| 7.4 | Forge_Dev | P1 | Tier 1 regex pattern refinement — run regex extraction on 1000 real chunks. What entities appear? Which patterns hit? Which miss? What new patterns needed for production data? Report entity yield by type and pattern. | DONE (94.2% coverage, 3311 c/s. Phone pattern over-matches. Evidence: SLICE_7_4_REGEX_EXTRACTION_EVIDENCE_2026-04-08.md) | reviewer |
| 7.5 | Forge_Dev | P1 | Tier 2 GLiNER vs regex comparison — run both on same 1000 chunks. Compare: entity count, type coverage, unique entities found by GLiNER that regex missed, confidence distribution. Quantify the value-add of GLiNER over regex-only. | DONE (100 chunks, complementary methods, 82 GLiNER-only entities. Evidence: SLICE_7_5_GLINER_VS_REGEX_EVIDENCE_2026-04-08.md) | reviewer |
| 7.6 | Forge_Dev | P1 | Sample enrichment quality — enrich 100 real chunks with phi4:14B. Review preambles: are they accurate? Do they improve retrievability? Compare enriched vs non-enriched retrieval on 10 test queries. | SKIPPED (time constraint — enrichment deferred per 7.9 recommendation) | reviewer |
| 7.7 | Forge_Dev | P0 | Full pipeline proof on 1000-file subset — parse + dedup + chunk + embed + extract (no enrich for speed). End-to-end validation on real data. Report all metrics. | DONE (TEXT-ONLY. 947/1000 parsed, 83,022 chunks+vectors. Export: C:\CorpusForge_Dev\data\output_dev\export_20260408_2051. Evidence: SLICE_7_7_E2E_PROOF_EVIDENCE_2026-04-08.md) | reviewer |
| 7.8 | Forge_Dev | P0 | V2 import test — export the 1000-file subset, import into V2_Dev clone, run golden eval. Does real production data produce usable query results? | DONE (accepted export `C:\CorpusForge_Dev\data\output_dev\export_20260408_2051` consumed in `V2_Dev`; import/extraction/eval evidence captured. Direct corpus-native probes are usable, but mainline promotion stays on hold because relationship rows remained `0`, entity noise is high, and the golden gate failed.) | reviewer |
| 7.9 | Forge_Dev | P1 | Recovery strategy recommendation — based on all findings, document: optimal dedup approach, recommended extraction tiers, chunking params, enrichment value, estimated time for full 700GB pipeline. Feed into Sprint 6 decisions. | DONE (text-first ~55 min, .rsf defer, two-pass extraction, Tesseract needed for Phase 2. Evidence: SLICE_7_9_RECOVERY_STRATEGY_2026-04-08.md) | reviewer |

**Exit Criteria:** Data-driven understanding of production corpus characteristics. Dedup strategy proven on 90GB. Extraction patterns refined on real data. Chunking/enrichment quality validated. Recovery strategy documented with real numbers.

**Hash continuity rule:** Whatever dedup approach is used, hash-based incremental skip must survive. When the remaining 610GB arrives or we reconnect to production source, already-processed files must be recognized and skipped by hash.

## Sprint 7 Follow-On (Forge_Dev): Config Hardening + Operator Readiness

**Added:** 2026-04-08 | **Agent:** reviewer (support/config lane, CPU-only)
**Purpose:** Convert Sprint 7 lessons into reusable operator artifacts. No new GPU-heavy work.

| Slice | Repo | Priority | What | Status | Owner |
|-------|------|----------|------|--------|-------|
| 7F.1 | Forge_Dev | P1 | Demo text-only config preset (config.demo_text_only.yaml) — defers images/archives/sensor/.xml by config | DONE | reviewer |
| 7F.2 | Forge_Dev | P1 | Skip/defer visibility — remove 8-format truncation in run_pipeline.py, add per-extension breakdown to run_report.txt | DONE (2 code patches, safe to cherry-pick) | reviewer |
| 7F.3 | Forge_Dev | P1 | Failure taxonomy for 53 unparsed files — restricted into scanned PDF (24), DOCX parser bug (14), edge-case PDF (10), image PPTX (2), XLSX (1) | DONE (FAILURE_TAXONOMY_7_7_2026-04-08.md) | reviewer |
| 7F.4 | Forge_Dev | P1 | Workstation prerequisite plan — Tesseract, Poppler, ONNX install/verify guide | DONE (WORKSTATION_PREREQUISITES_2026-04-08.md) | reviewer |
| 7F.5 | Forge_Dev | P1 | Operator runbook — demo text-only export, defer confirmation, skip accounting | DONE (OPERATOR_RUNBOOK_DEMO_TEXT_ONLY_2026-04-08.md) | reviewer |

**Exit Criteria:** Operator can run a demo-safe text-only export using the preset, see all deferred formats with reasons, and knows what to install for Phase 2.

## Sprint 8 (Infra): Clone Repo Setup for Parallel Development (NEW)

**Added:** 2026-04-08 | **Agent:** reviewer (new, infrastructure)
**Purpose:** Set up clone repos so multiple agents can work in parallel without file conflicts.

| Slice | Repo | Priority | What | Status | Owner |
|-------|------|----------|------|--------|-------|
| 8.1 | primary workstation | P0 | Clone CorpusForge: `git clone C:\CorpusForge C:\CorpusForge_Dev`. Rebuild venv from scratch (`python -m venv .venv && pip install -r requirements.txt`). Do NOT copy .venv. Verify CUDA: `python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"`. | TODO | reviewer |
| 8.2 | primary workstation | P0 | Clone HybridRAG V2: `git clone C:\HybridRAG_V2 C:\HybridRAG_V2_Dev`. Rebuild venv from scratch. Verify CUDA + all imports work. | TODO | reviewer |
| 8.3 | primary workstation | P0 | Create config.local.yaml for each clone: separate output_dir (avoid conflicts with main repo), separate GPU assignment (clone gets GPU 1, main gets GPU 0). Point Forge_Dev source_dirs at `C:\CorpusForge\ProductionSource`. | TODO | reviewer |
| 8.4 | primary workstation | P0 | Verify clone isolation: run pipeline in Forge_Dev, confirm output goes to clone's output dir, confirm main repo is untouched. Run pytest in both clones. | TODO | reviewer |
| 8.5 | primary workstation | P1 | Document clone workflow: how to pull updates from main, how to sync findings back, rules (never push from clone, code changes in main only). | TODO | reviewer |

**Clone Exit Criteria:** Both clone repos functional with independent venvs, configs, and output dirs. Main repos untouched by clone activity.

## Docs / Sanitizer / Test-Plan Lane (2026-04-09)

| Slice | Repo | Priority | What | Status | Owner |
|-------|------|----------|------|--------|-------|
| 7G.1 | Both | P1 | Remove the workstation nickname from remote-bound theory docs, sprint boards, and handover; add sanitizer parity rule so the nickname does not reappear in tracked docs | DONE | reviewer |
| 7G.2 | Forge | P1 | Restore Source-to-V2 assembly-line guide with worker override, hash continuity, and human-vs-automatic flow | DONE | reviewer |
| 7G.3 | Forge | P1 | Rewrite the golden/canary plan around the real 53-file dry run, the Sprint 7 1000-file subset, the current clean export, the V2 import handoff, and the hashed-state resume check | DONE | reviewer |
| 7G.4 | Forge | P1 | Correct operator/runtime docs so `config/config.yaml` is the live runtime config and GUI Save Settings target; retire mainline `config.local` guidance | DONE | reviewer |
| 7G.5 | Forge | P2 | Call out that low GPU during parse is expected because parse is mostly CPU/I/O/OCR bound, then fold tonight's docs-lane details into the handover | DONE | reviewer |
| 7G.6 | Both | P2 | Run sanitizer verification after the doc refresh and confirm the workstation nickname does not regress in remote-bound docs or sprint boards | DONE (2026-04-09; final V2 `CHANGELOG.md` sanitizer hit removed, both repo dry-runs clean) | reviewer |

**Docs Lane Exit Criteria:** Remote-bound docs and synced sprint boards stay sanitize-clean; CorpusForge docs reflect `config/config.yaml` as the live runtime config; the canary/golden plan names the real data subsets, current clean export, V2 import path, and hashed-resume expectation; handover captures tonight's docs lane.

## Parallel Recovery / Adaptation Queue (2026-04-09)

**Added:** 2026-04-09 | **Purpose:** connect Forge-side corpus adaptation work to V2 routing, retrieval, and GPU-use planning.

| Slice | Repo | Priority | What | Status | Owner |
|-------|------|----------|------|--------|-------|
| CA.1 | Forge | P0 | Corpus adaptation profiling: run the new profiler on the local sample tree now, then on the next real Forge export artifacts (`manifest.json`, `run_report.txt`, `skip_manifest.json`, `chunks.jsonl`, failure list/log`). Write evidence note with generic document-family findings only. Artifact: `C:\CorpusForge\docs\CORPUS_ADAPTATION_EVIDENCE_2026-04-09.md`. | READY FOR QA | reviewer |
| CA.2 | Forge | P0 | Family-aware skip/defer hardening: convert high-confidence profiler findings into visible skip/defer candidates for OCR sidecars, derivative junk, encrypted-PDF naming cues, and archive-duplicate reporting where precision justifies it. Add tests only when a runtime rule is promoted. | READY FOR QA (2026-04-09; Forge artifacts at `C:\CorpusForge\docs\SKIP_DEFER_HARDENING_2026-04-09.md`, `C:\CorpusForge\docs\SKIP_DEFER_HARDENING_2026-04-09_live_config_smoke.txt`, and `C:\CorpusForge\docs\SKIP_DEFER_HARDENING_2026-04-09_proof.json`) | reviewer |
| CA.3 | V2 | P1 | Family-aware query-routing plan: map generic document families into query classification, retrieval weighting, metadata usage, and table-vs-narrative handling. Planning/doc lane first unless a very small safe code improvement is obvious. Artifact: `docs/FAMILY_AWARE_QUERY_ROUTING_PLAN_2026-04-09.md`. | READY FOR QA | reviewer |
| CA.4 | Both | P1 | GPU execution guidance plan: define which stages should use one GPU, an additional local GPU, or CPU-only paths across Forge and V2; distinguish proven paths from experiments. | READY TO ASSIGN | reviewer |
| CA.QA | Both | P0 | QA adaptation planning/runtime lanes as they land. Runtime-changing lanes require targeted tests and proof artifacts; GUI changes still require full harness plus non-author smash. | READY | reviewer |

**Queue Artifacts:** `C:\CorpusForge\docs\CORPUS_ADAPTATION_PLAN_2026-04-09.md`, `C:\CorpusForge\docs\DOCUMENT_FAMILY_MATRIX_2026-04-09.md`, and V2 follow-on planning docs such as `docs/FAMILY_AWARE_QUERY_ROUTING_PLAN_2026-04-09.md`.

**Clone Rules (carry forward):**
- Clones are for testing/development ONLY — never push from a clone
- All code changes happen in main repo, then `git pull` into clone
- Each clone gets its own config.local.yaml (different output dirs, GPU assignment)
- Venv MUST be rebuilt from scratch — copied venvs break on Windows (hardcoded paths)
