# Purpose: Implements the golden probes part of the application runtime.
# What to read first: Start at the top-level function/class definitions and follow calls downward.
# Inputs: Configuration values, command arguments, or data files used by this module.
# Outputs: Returned values, written files, logs, or UI updates produced by this module.
# Safety notes: Update small sections at a time and run relevant tests after edits.

golden_probes.py -- Multi-Domain Hallucination Test Data
=========================================================
Known-true/false claims across 13 STEM domains. The NLI model
checks claims against source text. The filter MUST catch the
false ones. To add a domain: write source text, add true/false
claims, run rag-diag to verify.
